This Headless Comments Management System (Headless CMS for the friends, what a coincidence!) is basically a platform that provides you with reddit-like commenting system as a service, just like Disqus, but without a Frontend, just the API, that can be integrated seamlessly with your existing Backend.

Key features:

* **Zero friction for your users**: Your users will never need to create an extra account just for commenting, they will be able to comment on your website using the same account they use for your website, or without account if you want to allow that.
* **Zero friction for the developers**: You can orchestrate all the commenting logic from your Backend, using a simple API that you can learn to use in 30 minutes.
* **No setup required**: You don't need to install anything, just use the API and you are ready to go.
* **Support for mentions**:  We scan the comments for @mentions and automatically link them to your users.
